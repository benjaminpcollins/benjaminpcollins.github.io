I attended the IMPRS-HD Summer School “New Opportunities to Test Cosmology” at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. The school covered fundamental topics in modern cosmology, including dark matter, inflation, general relativity, structure formation, and opportunities for testing new physics. Lectures and workshops provided hands-on experience and fostered discussions on current challenges in observational and theoretical cosmology.
