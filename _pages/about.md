    <h2>üí° About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a recent graduate from the master's degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Bologna, with a life-long passion for astronomy. Before that, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Technical Physics from the Vienna University of Technology, where I spent five months at Loughborough University (UK) as part of the Erasmus+ programme. I am now looking to continue my research through a PhD, where I hope to further explore the formation and properties of high-redshift galaxies using cutting-edge observational data from JWST, complemented by ground-based observing facilities.

    <h2>üî≠ Research</h2>
    <p>
      My research interests focus on <strong>observational astrophysics</strong>, particularly <em>high-redshift galaxies</em>, 
      <em>black hole formation</em>, and the <em>evolution of cosmic structure</em>. 
      Currently, I analyse photometric data from the <strong>MIRI instrument onboard JWST</strong>, 
      taken by the PRIMER, COSMOS-Web, and COSMOS-3D surveys in the COSMOS field.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, I am focusing on a sample of galaxies between 1.7 < <i>z<i> < 3.5 observed in the BlueJay survey to investigate dust energy balance by comparing existing model spectra to the measured MIRI photometry. Through this exciting project I have gained valuable experience working with astronomical data, building a custom photometric pipeline and working closely with PROSPECTOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      These analyses will contribute to a forthcoming photometric catalogue release that will enable 
      further investigation of dusty, early-universe galaxies observed by JWST.
