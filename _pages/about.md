## About me üñäÔ∏è
I am a recent graduate from the master's degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Bologna, with a strong passion for astronomy. Before coming to Bologna, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Technical Physics from the Vienna University of Technology, where spent five months at Loughborough University (UK) as part of the Erasmus+ programme. Studying in England and meeting people from various cultural and academic backgrounds has had a strong influence on my personal and academic development.

My research interests focus on observational astrophysics, particularly **high-redshift galaxies, black hole formation, and the evolution of cosmic structure**. My current research involves analysing photometric data from the **mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST**, taken by the PRIMER, COSMOS-Web and COSMOS-3D surveys in the COSMOS field, and compiling a photometric catalogue. 

In particular, I am focusing on a sample of galaxies between 1.7 < *z* < 3.5 observed in the BlueJay survey to investigate dust energy balance by comparing existing model spectra to the measured MIRI photometry. Through this exciting project I have gained valuable experience working with astronomical data and building a custom photometric pipeline for future studies with MIRI.

During my studies, I also worked with ALMA, UVES, and Chandra/NuSTAR datasets, developing skills in CASA, Xspec, and ds9 for data analysis and visualisation.

I am now looking to continue my research through a PhD, where I hope to further explore the formation and properties of high-redshift galaxies using cutting-edge observational data from JWST, complemented by ground-based observing facilities.
